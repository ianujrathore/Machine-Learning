# Machine-Learning

What is Machine Learning? 🤖
* Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Key Uses of Machine Learning:

* Healthcare: Disease prediction, medical imaging analysis
* Finance: Fraud detection, stock market predictions
* E-commerce: Product recommendations, customer behavior analysis
* Transportation: Self-driving cars, route optimization
* Social Media: Content recommendations, spam detection
* Smart Assistants: Voice recognition, chatbots

Types of Machine Learning
Briefly introduce the main types:

* Supervised Learning: Learns from labeled data (e.g., predicting house prices).
* Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).
* Reinforcement Learning: Learns by trial and error to maximize rewards (e.g., training robots or game AI).

# SUPERVISED LEARNING MODEL
* Regression Model : A regression model in machine learning is a type of supervised learning model used to predict a continuous numerical value based on one or more input features.

How a regression model works
* You provide training data with:
Inputs (features) → e.g., size of a house
Output (target) → e.g., house price
The model learns the relationship between inputs and outputs.
It uses that relationship to predict new values.

Mathematically, it tries to learn a function like:
𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)

where:
x = input features
y = predicted continuous value

## Common types of regression models

* Linear Regression – models a straight-line relationship
* Multiple Linear Regression – uses multiple inputs
* Polynomial Regression – models curved relationships
* Ridge & Lasso Regression – linear regression with regularization
* Decision Tree Regression – models decisions using a tree-like structure
* Random Forest Regression – combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy
* Support Vector Regression (SVR) – fits data within a margin of tolerance using support vectors
* Neural Network Regression – learns complex non-linear patterns using layered neurons
* XGBoost Regression – uses gradient boosting with optimized speed and performance
* LightGBM Regression – fast gradient boosting using histogram-based tree learning
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – Regression predicts values based on the average of nearest data points
* And more

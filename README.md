What is Machine Learning? 🤖
* Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Key Uses of Machine Learning:

* Healthcare: Disease prediction, medical imaging analysis
* Finance: Fraud detection, stock market predictions
* E-commerce: Product recommendations, customer behavior analysis
* Transportation: Self-driving cars, route optimization
* Social Media: Content recommendations, spam detection
* Smart Assistants: Voice recognition, chatbots

Types of Machine Learning
Briefly introduce the main types:

* Supervised Learning: Learns from labeled data (e.g., predicting house prices).
* Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).
* Reinforcement Learning: Learns by trial and error to maximize rewards (e.g., training robots or game AI).
